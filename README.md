OpenGaleFile
========================
### GaleFile2: The Revenge of GaleFile

OpenGaleFile is a library for loading up the GAL file format from the Graphics Gale program (found at [https://graphicsgale.com/us/](https://graphicsgale.com/us/)), which is primarily focused at creating and animated pixel art.

Since the provided DLL by the creators of Graphics Gale is a Windows-only 32-bit library, the platforms where GALs can be directly read is terribly limited without roundabout solutions.
